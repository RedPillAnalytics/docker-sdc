## Description
This is a POC of StreamSets Data Collector on Docker for the Innive framework

## Source
The Dockerfile and its related information is from streamsets/datacollector-kubernetes: https://github.com/streamsets/datacollector-kubernetes  
While there is a Streamsets Docker repo, the Dockerfile from the kubernetes repo is closer to what we need for the Innive framework.

The Docker repo can be found here: https://github.com/streamsets/datacollector-docker

## Changes
Explanation of changes to the original Dockerfile should be detailed here (easier to find than surfing commits)
